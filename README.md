# borealis 🌱

Be mindful of what you plant in your inner garden.

### What it is:
This is a simple app to track goals. Check in on your personal development without making it anxiety-inducing. Enjoy the process! 🙏

### Dependencies:
* Ruby 3.1.2
* Ruby on Rails 7.0.3.1

### To install and run:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `rails db:create`
4. Run `rails db:migrate`
5. Run `rails db:seed`
6. Run `./bin/rails` to start the server and Tailwind processes
7. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser

> **Tip**: Use [Overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind) to run the processes instead of `./bin/rails`. Pass it the `Procfile.dev` as a parameter, so that you may debug in a separate terminal window.
